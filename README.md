# CongressAPI and Next.js Tinkering

This project is a simple experiment where I'm tinkering with the CongressAPI and building a web application using Next.js. The goal is to explore the capabilities of the CongressAPI and create a basic web interface to display information about bills.

## What's Inside

- The project uses Next.js, a popular React framework, to build the web application.
- It fetches data from the CongressAPI to display information about bills proposed in Congress.
- You'll find components to list bills and display details about each bill.
